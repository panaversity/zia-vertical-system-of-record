# Status

What is true today, what is next, what blocks it. Changes weekly — which is why it is not in
`AGENTS.md`.

## Where it stands

**No code exists.** No build, no tests, no toolchain — documents and git history only. The design is settled
(`AGENTS.md` § Settled decisions); the kernel being extracted runs in production in two private
repos, surveyed at pinned SHAs in `docs/extraction.md`. **Nothing in this repository runs.**

The doc set was consolidated 2026-08-12 from seven files to four after a repeatable cold-read test
returned **converging** — the earlier tarball false-mechanism is dead, both readers "mostly-clear" —
while flagging that contradictions were accumulating between files. Superseded documents live in git
history (the root commit), not the tree.

## v0 scope

**`vsor init` → markdown in a folder → both surfaces serve it, honest about what it does not know.**

- Governance **level 0 only** — no `governance/` directory, which removes `sor-governance` from v0
  entirely.
- **One skill: `add-sources`** — the one the five-minute claim rests on.
- Naming stays Agent-Factory-flavoured; genericization comes later.

**Deferred, named as choices:** levels 1–4 · five of six skills · deployment targets beyond local ·
the customer-overlay mechanism (no schema support exists today — `corpus_id` is absent from all five
content tables) · brand genericization · the second vertical · migration tooling · benchmarks ·
governance process.

**Held open on purpose — decided at the keyboard, not from a document:** the build record's exact
fields (when writing `build`) · whether `git rev-parse HEAD:knowledge` is the right corpus identity
(first rebuild detection) · chunking parameters for a non-curriculum corpus (first non-book corpus) ·
whether site and ingest share one build (wiring `sor-site`) · level-0 floor behaviour (after the
experiment below).

## Prior-art study (2026-08-13) — folded in

Four frameworks were profiled in code at pinned SHAs (eve `1cd563b`, deepagents `217b9eb`, openclaw
`e45a946`, openai-agents-python `fc461ee`); full profiles and synthesis in the session scratchpad
(`study/`). Our settled decisions matched the field's convergence almost everywhere. The four
divergence flags were put to the owner and resolved:

| Flag (all four repos differ from us) | Resolution |
| :--- | :--- |
| One name for package and binary | **Adopted** — `vsor` everywhere; PyPI free; the ziavsor hedge was unnecessary |
| Fewer internal packages | **Rejected from experience** — upstream ran this domain as a monolith, paid for the split, and the split won. Package-per-domain stands; the tax is engineered out by lockstep versioning |
| Nobody gates releases on live-LLM evals | **Precondition added** — measure behavioural-eval flake rate (gold set × N runs) before wiring the gate (B3) |
| Single-language runtimes | **Stands as settled** — couple through `build.lock.json`, never lockstep releases across languages |

**Skeleton build plan additions from the study:** the scaffold is its own test suite (file-by-file
assertions including the negative ones — no `governance/`, no empty dirs); snapshot the compiled
surfaces from the first commit (`tools/list`, citation envelope, abstention text, `/health`, one
rendered page); AST boundary guards at **baseline zero**; protected wiring (serving without the
citation envelope or abstention path is a construction-time error); `vsor.testing` deterministic
doubles as public API; the eval verdict enum (gate / scored / tracked) visible in every result row;
docs in the wheel + a locator-only SKILL.md; a strict release profile where **a skip is a failure**;
one `make` vocabulary quoted by AGENTS.md and CI alike; supply-chain trio (uv cooldown, exact dev
pins, SHA-pinned actions); bounded corpus discovery copied from openclaw (file caps, symlink
containment); `add-sources` authored in the ecosystem SKILL.md format — **and every converted
document carries an origin-artifact record** (converter + version, source-bytes hash, page range,
human fidelity attestation), or an OCR error in a rate table ships with full authority.

**Never** (evidence in the study): implicit default embedder/model/floor · a vendoring pipeline ·
a guard-script zoo with debt baselines · committed generated artifacts.

**Unknowns opened by the 2026-08-13 decisions (model C · eject · deploy) — no coverage yet:**
who supplies the embedding key at level 0 (upstream requires `GEMINI_API_KEY`; an accountant has
none — local model in the wheel, keyless default, or scope the promise to developers) · whether the
five-minute promise is genuinely zero-tech when Test 1 starts with `docker compose up` (embedded
pglite+pgvector, or say plainly it is a developer promise at v0) · the default auth posture of a
**deployed** level-0 MCP server (the kit is fail-closed and the user has no SSO — refusing to boot
and an open server are both wrong) · version-pin mechanics (`instance.md` pins vsor; `uvx vsor` runs
latest — who honors the pin) · `eject` mechanics for Python (`lib/` path preference, and
upgrade-after-eject).

**New unknowns for the skeleton to measure:** behavioural-eval flake rate before gating · does
docs-in-the-wheel measurably help a coding agent (run Test 2 with and without) · Test 2 driven
entirely by a coding agent, human only pasting paths · serve-time token cost of the MCP prompt
surface on `fixtures/tiny/` · scaffold-upgrade story once 0.2.0 meets a 0.1.0 project (record enough
in `build.lock.json` to derive it later).

## Ship order — two slices (decided 2026-08-13)

**Slice 1 — the site surface.** `learn-app` extraction → `sor-site`; `vsor init` + `vsor build`
producing a branded website from `knowledge/` + `instance.md`. Needs **no database, no keys** —
shippable and demoable alone. Owns the two questions that belong at the keyboard: **Node at build
time** (model C promises the user never installs Node — candidate answers: a managed runtime the way
Playwright manages browsers, a prebuilt site shell in the wheel, or graceful skip) and the first
**`vsor eject site`** target. Earns the acceptance line "the site builds and the corpus is
browsable".

**Slice 2 — the MCP surface.** `sor-content` + `sor-platform` + `sor-gateway-kit` → `vsor serve`:
Postgres, embeddings, retrieval, abstention, on plumbing slice 1 proved. Earns the rest of Test 1
and all of Test 2.

## The two acceptance tests

They measure different things; conflating them was a past defect.

**Test 1 — skeleton (proves the plumbing):**

```bash
docker compose up -d                     # postgres + pgvector
uvx vsor init demo                    # scaffolds, git init, installs
cd demo && vsor build && vsor serve

curl -s localhost:8080/health | jq .     # 200; abstain gate reported as uncalibrated
# MCP tools/list returns exactly: outline, read, search
# a search for a phrase in the corpus returns a hit with a provenance block
# the site builds and the corpus is browsable
# build.lock.json exists and is committed
```

Corpus: `fixtures/tiny/` — ~10 markdown files with frontmatter.

**Test 2 — five minutes (proves the product claim):** from a real PDF, through a real agent, using
`add-sources`, timed. `init` → "pull in these PDFs" → "put it live" → a cited answer, and an honest
refusal for something the PDFs do not cover. **Under 5 minutes wall clock, or the finding is the
deliverable** — record where the time went.

**The first experiment:** can a usable abstention floor be derived from a ten-file corpus? The
production floor took 416 gold queries + 38 probes. Level 0 ships with the gate off and `/health`
saying so; if a floor is underivable at small scale, the honest default may become a conservative
fixed floor plus an *uncalibrated* badge. Recording this result is a v0 deliverable.

**v0 gold set:** ~10 in-corpus questions + 5 out-of-corpus probes against `fixtures/tiny/`, row
schema `{q, expect, source, kind}` (+ optional `also_ok`). Probes must include scope-adjacent
near-misses.

## Shippable checklist

- [ ] Installable from a registry with a pinnable version
- [ ] README in the proven order (one sentence → tree → quickstart → complete example → docs →
      support → licence → stability statement)
- [ ] Docs shipped inside the package (offline ground truth for agents)
- [ ] Scaffold runs on the very next command with zero edits
- [ ] CI green: lint · typecheck · unit · boundary · smoke · scaffold-builds
- [ ] LICENSE · CONTRIBUTING · CODE_OF_CONDUCT · **SECURITY.md as a normative triage boundary** (operator trust model, itemized out-of-scope, pre-answered false-positive patterns) + a short THREAT_MODEL.md for the write door and MCP surface
- [ ] CHANGELOG with breaking changes in prose, from release one
- [ ] Publish **0.1.0 quietly**; let usage move the number; announce at whatever it reaches. State
      the 0.x contract (minor may break, patch does not) and a 1.0 *condition*, not a date

## Open decisions

| # | Decision | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| B1 | Rights vocabulary | `rights_basis` references an executed agreement with enumerated `permitted_uses` + `serving_mode`; implement locator-only serving early, while it is one predicate. Ladder level 1 |
| B2 | Approval unit | A row keyed on `(source_id, content_hash, approver, date, scope)` — an edit un-approves exactly what it touched. `content_nodes.status` already filters every read. Level 4 |
| B3 | What gates a flip | Behavioural evals gate; relevance reports; correctness ratchets. Degraded path fails closed. **Precondition: measure behavioural-eval flake rate before wiring the gate** — no studied framework gates on live models |
| B4 | Identity & visibility | **A correctness defect, not a preference**: only the MCP surface has an access model, so private content would compile to a public site. OIDC discovery; a `visibility` key per collection; compiler refuses public surfaces for non-public content. Must be decided before any public surface ships |
| B5 | Migration policy | The deployed artifact is the build, not the repo; unknown keys warn within a major; composition reads `schema_meta` and fails closed with a named remedy |

## Blocked on the repo owner

| Question | Blocks |
| :--- | :--- |
| **May code be copied from the two source repos?** `sor-agentfactory` has no LICENSE (all rights reserved by default); `ag2` is PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL. Both Panaversity-owned — a decision, not a negotiation — but unmade in writing, and `sor-agentfactory` is absent from the relicensing formality despite supplying the whole kernel. Until confirmed: read and cite, **do not copy**. | the extraction — not the skeleton |
| Questions needing people outside the room: the persona licence instrument (counsel + the expert) · EU AI Act Annex III classification (counsel) · AICPA independence exposure (accounting counsel) · rights-holder serving terms (the rights-holders) · the expert's sustainable review burden (the expert). | levels 1–4, the identity pack, the moat vertical |

*Resolved earlier: CLI language (Python, `uvx`) · dev database (docker pgvector) · what `build`
emits (`AGENTS.md` settled decision 8 — the tarball forensics that settled it are in git history) ·
the first commit and push (2026-08-13; history and remote exist, supersession is now enforceable).*
