# Status

What is true today, what is next, what blocks it. Changes weekly — which is why it is not in
`AGENTS.md`.

*Last updated: 2026-08-12*

## Where it stands

**No code exists.** Zero commits. No build, no tests, no toolchain. The design is settled
(`AGENTS.md` § Settled decisions); the kernel being extracted runs in production in two private
repos, surveyed at pinned SHAs in `docs/extraction.md`. **Nothing in this repository runs.**

The doc set was consolidated 2026-08-12 from seven files to four after a repeatable cold-read test
returned **converging** — the earlier tarball false-mechanism is dead, both readers "mostly-clear" —
while flagging that contradictions were accumulating between files. Superseded documents are in
`docs/archive/`.

## v0 scope

**`vsor init` → markdown in a folder → both surfaces serve it, honest about what it does not know.**

- Governance **level 0 only** — no `governance/` directory, which removes `sor-governance` from v0
  entirely.
- **One skill: `add-sources`** — the one the five-minute claim rests on.
- Naming stays Agent-Factory-flavoured; genericization comes later.

**Deferred, named as choices:** levels 1–4 · five of six skills · deployment targets beyond local ·
the customer-overlay mechanism (no schema support exists today — `corpus_id` is absent from all five
content tables) · brand genericization · the second vertical · migration tooling · benchmarks ·
governance process.

**Held open on purpose — decided at the keyboard, not from a document:** the build record's exact
fields (when writing `build`) · whether `git rev-parse HEAD:knowledge` is the right corpus identity
(first rebuild detection) · chunking parameters for a non-curriculum corpus (first non-book corpus) ·
whether site and ingest share one build (wiring `sor-site`) · level-0 floor behaviour (after the
experiment below).

## The two acceptance tests

They measure different things; conflating them was a past defect.

**Test 1 — skeleton (proves the plumbing):**

```bash
docker compose up -d                     # postgres + pgvector
uvx ziavsor init demo                    # scaffolds, git init, installs
cd demo && vsor build && vsor serve

curl -s localhost:8080/health | jq .     # 200; abstain gate reported as uncalibrated
# MCP tools/list returns exactly: outline, read, search
# a search for a phrase in the corpus returns a hit with a provenance block
# the site builds and the corpus is browsable
# build.lock.json exists and is committed
```

Corpus: `fixtures/tiny/` — ~10 markdown files with frontmatter.

**Test 2 — five minutes (proves the product claim):** from a real PDF, through a real agent, using
`add-sources`, timed. `init` → "pull in these PDFs" → "put it live" → a cited answer, and an honest
refusal for something the PDFs do not cover. **Under 5 minutes wall clock, or the finding is the
deliverable** — record where the time went.

**The first experiment:** can a usable abstention floor be derived from a ten-file corpus? The
production floor took 416 gold queries + 38 probes. Level 0 ships with the gate off and `/health`
saying so; if a floor is underivable at small scale, the honest default may become a conservative
fixed floor plus an *uncalibrated* badge. Recording this result is a v0 deliverable.

**v0 gold set:** ~10 in-corpus questions + 5 out-of-corpus probes against `fixtures/tiny/`, row
schema `{q, expect, source, kind}` (+ optional `also_ok`). Probes must include scope-adjacent
near-misses.

## Shippable checklist

- [ ] Installable from a registry with a pinnable version
- [ ] README in the proven order (one sentence → tree → quickstart → complete example → docs →
      support → licence → stability statement)
- [ ] Docs shipped inside the package (offline ground truth for agents)
- [ ] Scaffold runs on the very next command with zero edits
- [ ] CI green: lint · typecheck · unit · boundary · smoke · scaffold-builds
- [ ] LICENSE · CONTRIBUTING · SECURITY · CODE_OF_CONDUCT
- [ ] CHANGELOG with breaking changes in prose, from release one
- [ ] Publish **0.1.0 quietly**; let usage move the number; announce at whatever it reaches. State
      the 0.x contract (minor may break, patch does not) and a 1.0 *condition*, not a date

## Open decisions

| # | Decision | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| B1 | Rights vocabulary | `rights_basis` references an executed agreement with enumerated `permitted_uses` + `serving_mode`; implement locator-only serving early, while it is one predicate. Ladder level 1 |
| B2 | Approval unit | A row keyed on `(source_id, content_hash, approver, date, scope)` — an edit un-approves exactly what it touched. `content_nodes.status` already filters every read. Level 4 |
| B3 | What gates a flip | Behavioural evals gate; relevance reports; correctness ratchets. Degraded path fails closed |
| B4 | Identity & visibility | **A correctness defect, not a preference**: only the MCP surface has an access model, so private content would compile to a public site. OIDC discovery; a `visibility` key per collection; compiler refuses public surfaces for non-public content. Must be decided before any public surface ships |
| B5 | Migration policy | The deployed artifact is the build, not the repo; unknown keys warn within a major; composition reads `schema_meta` and fails closed with a named remedy |

## Blocked on the repo owner

| Question | Blocks |
| :--- | :--- |
| **May code be copied from the two source repos?** `sor-agentfactory` has no LICENSE (all rights reserved by default); `ag2` is PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL. Both Panaversity-owned — a decision, not a negotiation — but unmade in writing, and `sor-agentfactory` is absent from the relicensing formality despite supplying the whole kernel. Until confirmed: read and cite, **do not copy**. | the extraction — not the skeleton |
| **First commit.** Zero commits makes "supersession is visible" and "corrected in the same commit" unenforceable. | every history-dependent discipline |
| Questions needing people outside the room: the persona licence instrument (counsel + the expert) · EU AI Act Annex III classification (counsel) · AICPA independence exposure (accounting counsel) · rights-holder serving terms (the rights-holders) · the expert's sustainable review burden (the expert). | levels 1–4, the identity pack, the moat vertical |

*Resolved earlier: CLI language (Python, `uvx`) · dev database (docker pgvector) · what `build`
emits (`AGENTS.md` settled decision 8 — the tarball forensics that settled it are archived).*
